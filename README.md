# Air_Pollution_monitoring_system
Air pollution is a significant environmental issue affecting the health and well-being of people worldwide. Accurate and
continuous monitoring of air quality is essential for mitigating adverse health effects and informing policy decisions. This
project leverages modern IoT technologies to create a cost-effective and efficient air pollution monitoring system using the
ESP32 microcontroller, a suite of air quality sensors, an LCD for local display, and cloud integration for data storage and
analysis.
Proposed System
The proposed system integrates the ESP32 microcontroller with MQ-4, MQ-7, and MQ-135 sensors to monitor various air
pollutants, including methane, carbon monoxide, and other harmful gases. The system features an LCD display for real-time
air quality readings and a buzzer that activates when air quality reaches unsafe levels. Air quality data is also uploaded to the
ThingSpeak cloud platform, enabling remote monitoring and data analysis.
